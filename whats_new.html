            <h1>Alpha Flight API<br>V 0.4.0</h1>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This week we mostly worked on our machine learning model. Although it is not ready yet, we have decided to implement a protoype of what will be the final product.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since our project is meant to be an application programming interface ready to be used in any kind of project we updated our "Predict Delay" page to use an actual function instead of "f(x)=x" to demo what it would look like after its implementation.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also we have determined our schedule for the following weeks, which is;<br>-By 15/04/2021 : Our machine learning model will be ready and functional.<br>-By 22/04/2021 : The program will be turned into an API ready for its beta tests.<br>-By 29/04/2021 : The documentation of the API will be finalized.<br>-By 06/05/2021 : A.F.A. V 1.0.0 will be ready and operational.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To learn more about the current status of our project you can read the presentation file of the week.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This week we have not done a whole lot in our machine learning department due some some issues caused by the way that date and time is stored in our dataset. So this week we decided to work on solving this issue instead. If you would like know more about it you can read the peresentation file of the week.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also we have decided to re-do the entire website again so if you would like to view the older versions you can download them below in the resources.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Last week we had a lot of progress in our machine learning department. Altough we had such progress it was cut short due to the computer of our Python Developer Dennis Brezina's computer crashing due to the sheer amount of data ( About 7GBs ) in our dataset.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to "What's New" page of our site. Here we will be updating on the progress of our project on a weekly basis. Even though we currently do not possess the technical knowledge to call it a machine learning project, we have developed an algorithm which later on will be used in our machine learning project. And since our project is an API that can be implemented across various projects we decided to develop a website to demo our API (even though it is not ready). If you wish to access additional resources such as; diagrams,code, reports etc. there will be links below in every log to access them.</p>
